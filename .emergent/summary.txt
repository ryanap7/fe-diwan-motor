The AI engineer iteratively developed a multi-branch POS and Inventory system for a motorbike store. Initial focus was on the Configuration Module, including branch management, company profiles, and user roles. Key challenges involved implementing dynamic UI elements (like submenus and hierarchical categories), ensuring robust backend API authorization, and managing complex file translations. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, addressing syntax errors, and adapting to user feedback for UI/UX refinements and feature prioritization. There was a notable effort to move user/role assignment logic to the branch module for better validation and to translate the entire UI to Indonesian, which proved challenging due to tool limitations and led to a strategic re-evaluation of the translation approach. The project transitioned from foundational setup to core feature implementation, with product management being the current focus.

3.  **User Roles Definition:** Admin, Branch Manager, Cashier, with simple username/password login. Roles are fixed (not editable/deletable by users).
4.  **User-Branch Assignment:** Each branch must have exactly one cashier and one branch manager, assigned directly from the Branch Management menu to prevent duplicates.
5.  **User Activity Log (FR-USR-004):** Track all user activities.
**Subsequent Scope (Product Management):**
1.  **Category Management (FR-PRD-005):** Hierarchical (parent/child) category management.
2.  **Master Data:** Brand/Merk, Model kendaraan/mesin (compatible), Unit of Measure (UOM).
3.  **Product Management (FR-PRD-001, FR-PRD-004, FR-PRD-006 to FR-PRD-011):**
    *   CRUD operations for products with details: Part Number/SKU, Product Name, Category/Sub-category, Brand/Merk, Compatible vehicle model (text field), UOM, Purchase Price, Sales Price (multiple price levels: retail, wholesale, member), Barcode, Product Images (multiple URLs, max 5), Technical Specifications, Storage Location.
    *   Automatic barcode/SKU generation.
    *   Tag/label products for filtering.
    *   Product bundling (package products).
    *   Time-based pricing/promotions.
    *   Volume discount rules.
    *   Margin analysis per product.
    *   Stock per branch.
    *   **Excluded:** Bulk import via Excel/CSV (FR-PRD-002) and Bulk update products (FR-PRD-003).
**General Requirements:**
*   All menu items, labels, and copywriting must be in Bahasa Indonesia.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the Product Management module. The user had just confirmed the detailed requirements for product management, including full CRUD, multiple price levels, stock per branch, margin calculation, tags/labels, compatible models, multiple images (via URLs), and UOM dropdown. The user also explicitly removed bulk import/update functionality from the scope.

The AI engineer successfully created the initial  component. This component is currently a placeholder and does not yet contain the full UI or logic for product management. The next immediate step identified by the AI engineer is to add the corresponding backend API endpoints for products in the  file, which is crucial for handling product data storage and retrieval.
