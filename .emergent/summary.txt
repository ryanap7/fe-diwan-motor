The AI engineer successfully implemented several core modules for a multi-branch POS and Inventory Management system. The work started with Product Management, including full CRUD, simplified pricing (normal, wholesale), and a percentage-based promotion system. Challenges included fixing  empty value errors and refining frontend data mapping. Next, the Inventory Management module was built in three sub-modules: Stock Management (real-time stock, multi-branch, transfers, adjustments), Restock and Purchase Order (PO creation, tracking, receiving goods), and Stock Movement (activity logs). User feedback led to removing batch tracking and simplifying PO status workflow. Finally, the Supplier Management module was implemented with basic CRUD, later simplified to remove performance tracking and product mapping, and Customer Management was added with CRUD, segmentation, and purchase history. The engineer iteratively refined both frontend components and backend APIs, addressing UI/UX issues and adapting to user-specific requirements, such as simplifying pricing and promo mechanisms.

The user requested a multi-branch Point of Sale (POS) and Inventory Management system for a motorbike store, emphasizing a modern, interactive UI. The initial scope covered Configuration (Branch, Company, Roles, User-Branch Assignment, Activity Log). Subsequently, Product Management was detailed, including CRUD with part number, name, hierarchical categories, brand, compatible models, UOM, purchase/sales prices (multiple levels), barcode generation, multiple images (URLs), technical specs, and storage location. Product bundling, time-based pricing, volume discounts, and margin analysis were also required, with bulk import/update explicitly excluded. All UI elements needed to be in Bahasa Indonesia.

Following this, Inventory Management was requested, split into:
1.  **Stock Management:** Real-time updates, multi-location support, stock transfer, adjustments, physical count, batch/serial tracking, expiry dates.
2.  **Restock and Purchase Order:** Minimum stock alerts, auto-PO suggestions, PO creation/management, goods receipt, outstanding PO tracking.
3.  **Stock Movement:** Logging, mutation reports, per-item history.

Later, **Supplier Management** involved CRUD (name, contact, address, terms), tracking performance, and product-supplier mapping. Finally, **Customer Management** required CRUD (name, contact, address, category), segmentation (retail, wholesale, VIP), and purchase history.

-   
    -   **Importance:** Manages supplier data.
    -   **Changes:** New component created. Implemented CRUD for suppliers. Initially included Performance Tracking and Product Mapping features, but these were later removed as per user request, simplifying the module to basic supplier data management.
-   
    -   **Importance:** Manages customer data.
    -   **Changes:** New component created. Implemented CRUD for customers, including segmentation (Retail, Wholesale, VIP) and display of purchase history.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the full Indonesian translation of all UI elements, especially in  and , as this process was halted due to complexity and token limits.
-   Integrate  helper function into all relevant CRUD operations (create, update, delete for users, branches, company, categories, brands, products, inventory, purchase orders, suppliers, customers). (Some logging is already present, but comprehensive application is pending).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on the **Customer Management module**. This involved implementing the  component and updating the backend API () to handle customer data. The module was successfully implemented, allowing for CRUD operations on customer data (name, contact, address, category).

Key features delivered include:
*   **Customer Segmentation (FR-CUS-002):** Customers are categorized (Retail, Wholesale, VIP) with visual badges and filter options.
*   **Customer Purchase History (FR-CUS-004):** A History button on each customer card provides access to their transaction history.
*   **UI/UX:** A clean, card-based design with search, filter, and actions (Edit, History, Power/toggle, Delete).
*   **Backend API:** CRUD endpoints for customers, supporting segmentation and initial mock purchase history data. Default customer data was initialized in the system.

The module was tested via screenshots, which confirmed its functionality, despite some automation timeouts. The user confirmed Cool to this module and proceeded to the next.
