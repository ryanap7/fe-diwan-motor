The AI engineer successfully implemented a multi-branch POS and Inventory Management system. The work encompassed addressing user feedback on existing modules, developing new modules, and enhancing data presentation. Key modifications included removing customer segmentation and transforming Activity Logs into a paginated table. A new POS Transactions module was developed for admin/branch manager roles, focusing on transaction display, filtering, and detail viewing, with simplifications like enforcing Selesai status and Cash payment. UI/UX improvements covered fixing date input styles, changing product image input to file uploads, and removing a Cashier filter. The Dashboard was enhanced with more insightful statistics, and a Reporting & Analytics module was introduced. Significant effort was dedicated to creating realistic dummy data across all modules. Furthermore, the Purchase Order module was refined to support multiple items per PO, and a critical bug where ordered quantities were incorrectly recorded as zero was fixed. The final task, currently in progress, is relocating user information from the sidebar to the header.

The user requested a multi-branch POS and Inventory Management system for a motorbike store, featuring a modern, interactive UI and full Bahasa Indonesia support. Initial scope covered Configuration (Branch, Company, Roles, User-Branch Assignment, Activity Log) and comprehensive Product Management (CRUD, multi-level pricing, promotions). Inventory Management was detailed into Stock Management, Restock/Purchase Order (PO), and Stock Movement. Subsequently, Supplier Management and Customer Management were added. During development, customer segmentation was removed from the Customer module. A POS module was specified for Admin/Branch Manager, focusing on displaying transactions (search, filter, view detail, export), with cashier functions handled by a mobile app. Further refinements included simplifying transaction status to Selesai and payment method to Cash, enhancing Dashboard statistics, creating a Reporting and Analytics module, generating comprehensive and realistic dummy data, and enabling multi-item support for Purchase Orders with accurate quantity tracking.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user request to move the user's name and role information (e.g., bambang_jkt Branch Manager) from the application's sidebar to the header. This task involved modifying the  file. The user's specific instruction was to Di sidebar pidah ke header (From sidebar move to header).

The AI engineer has already performed the following actions:
1.  Identified the code section in  responsible for displaying user information in the sidebar.
2.  Successfully removed the user information display from the sidebar.
3.  Successfully added the user's name and role to the header section, positioned on the right side.

The system has processed these changes, and the next step is to visually verify these updates through a screenshot to ensure correct placement and styling in the UI.
